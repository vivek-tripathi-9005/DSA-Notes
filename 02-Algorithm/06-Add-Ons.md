# Abstract Data Type(ADT)
Abstract data types are like user defined data types which defines operations on values using function without specifying what is there inside function and how the operations are performed.
- The definition of ADT only mentions what operations to be performed but not how these operations will be implemented.
- It does not specify how data will be organized in memory and what algorithms will be used for implementing the operations.
- It is called “abstract” because it gives an implementation-independent view.
