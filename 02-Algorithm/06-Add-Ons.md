# Abstract Data Type(ADT)
Abstract data types are like user defined data types which defines operations on values using function without specifying what is there inside function and how the operations are performed.
- The definition of ADT only mentions what operations to be performed but not how these operations will be implemented.
- It does not specify how data will be organized in memory and what algorithms will be used for implementing the operations.
- It is called “abstract” because it gives an implementation-independent view.

# [Time-Space Trade-Off in Algorithms](https://utkarsh1504.github.io/DSA-Java/time_space_tradeoff)
Space-Time tradeoff in computer science is basically a problem solving technique in which we solve the problem:
- Either in less time and using more space, or
- In very little space by spending more time.
## Types of Time-Space Trade-Off
- Lookup tables or Recalculation
- Compressed or Uncompressed data
- Re Rendering or Stored images
- Smaller code or loop unrolling
