# Binary Tree Representations

Consider the following binary tree...

## Array Representation of Binary Tree
To represent a binary tree of depth **'n'** using array representation, we need one dimensional array with a maximum size of **$2^n + 1$**.

## Linked List Representation of Binary Tree
In this linked list representation, a node has the following structure...
