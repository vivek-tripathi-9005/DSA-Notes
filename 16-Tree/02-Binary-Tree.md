# Binary Tree

A binary tree is a tree data structure composed of nodes, each of which has at most, two children, referred to as left and right nodes and the tree begins from root node.

## Properties of Binary Tree

1. **The maximum number of nodes at level $l$ of a binary tree is $(2^{l - 1})$**.
2. **Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height 'h' is $(2^h – 1)$**.
3. **In a Binary tree in which every node has 0 or 2 children, the number of leaf nodes is always one more than the nodes with two children.**
4. **In a Binary Tree with $N$ nodes, the minimum possible height or the minimum number of levels is $Log_2(N+1)$.**
5. **A Binary Tree with $L$ leaves has at least $(Log_2L + 1)$ levels**.

## [Types of Binary Tree](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/types-of-binary-tree/)

**On the basis of completion of number of children:**
1. Full Binary Tree
2. Degenerate Binary Tree
3. Skewed Binary Trees

**On the basis of the completion of levels:**
1. Complete Binary Tree
2. Perfect Binary Tree
3. Balanced Binary Tree

**On the basis of node values:**
1. Binary Search Tree
2. AVL Tree
3. Red Black Tree
4. B Tree
5. B+ Tree
6. Segment Tree

## [Representation of Binary Tree ](16-Tree/03-Binary-Tree-Representation)
**A binary tree data structure is represented using two methods. Those methods are as follows**
1. Array Representation
2. Linked List Representation

## [Traversal of Binary Tree](16-Tree/05-Binary-Tree-Traversal)
Generally used way to traverse a binary tree are:
1. Inorder Traversal
2. Preorder Traversal
3. Postorder Traversal
